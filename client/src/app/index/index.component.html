                    Esports will bring in more than $1 billion in revenue worldwide
                    during 2019, according to a recent report from the Newzoo analyst
                    group. That would be a 26.4% boost from 2018, with the growth
                    largely driven by media rights deals, sponsorships, and
                    advertising sales.
